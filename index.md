## About
I am a graduate student studying Computer Science. My interests revolve around **Algorithmic Complexity, Data Structures, Software Engineering, and Distributed Systems**. Prior to this, I also worked as a Software Engineer at Odessa Inc. I enjoy working across multiple languages and am most comfortable with *C, Java, Python, and C#*.

## Experience
**Odessa Inc. - Software Engineer II**  
I was part of the Data Migration team, where I contributed to enhancing the in-house migration tool by designing new product functionalities, optimizing performance, and building custom migration modules. I also designed and implemented the company's first distributed data orchestration job to handle large-scale data transfers.

In addition, I worked on fixing bugs, writing and optimizing stored procedures, tuning slow SQL queries, creating test scenarios, mentoring junior developers, and supporting production releases.

## Projects

See my **[Github profile](https://github.com/nithinbharathi)** for my open-sourced code. Some of the projects I have worked on: 

- A **[Character level language model](https://github.com/nithinbharathi/wordgen)** that predicts the next character given a sequence of characters. In addition to the core MLP architecture, implemented the attention mechanism from scratch.  
- A **[linear algebra package for Java](https://github.com/nithinbharathi/JMatrix)**  
- An in-memory **[key-value store](https://github.com/nithinbharathi/kv_store)** implemented in C for pedagogical purposes 
- A **[reverse automatic differentiation engine](https://github.com/nithinbharathi/Scalargrad)** in Python for scalar arithmetic
- **[FM index implementation](https://github.com/nithinbharathi/pattern-matching-suite)** for maximal exact match finding and frequency counting.   

## Misc Links
The following are a collection of technical links that I have found to be interesting.

- Jeff Dean's talk on google's infrastructure **[Technology at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=modXC5IWTJI)** and techniques for reducing response times in large scale distributed systems **[Achieving Rapid Response Times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-3Ahy7Fxsc)**.
- **[Distributed Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQP8WApzIQQ&list=PL4YhK0pT0ZhXTRSAYHAgBcJkhlM2hlhw3)**: An interesting course that covers case study's about the various system architectures in use.
- We all love to write fast code and this course **[Performance Engineering of Software Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7h_sYMk_oc&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63VIBQVWguXxZZi0566y7Wf)** helped me understand the concepts involved in writing high performance software.
- **[LSM](https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying)**: Everything you will need to understand about the widely used Log Structured Merge Trees.
- Andrej Karpathy's wonderful **[Neural Network: Zero to Hero collection](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)**. I would highly recommend this playlist to anyone looking to get started with deep learning.

## About Me
I am a graduate student studying Computer Science. My interests revolve around **Algorithmic Complexity, Data Structures, Software Engineering, and Distributed Systems**. Prior to this, I also worked as a Software Engineer at Odessa Inc.

## Experience
**Odessa Inc. - Software Engineer II**  
At odessa, I was part of the data migration team wherein I worked on enhancing Odessa's Data Migration tool by implementing additional product functionalities, improving the performance of existing modules and developed new migration modules. I also architected and developed the company's first ever distributed data orchestration job for large scale data transfer.

Besides, I also spent a significant amount of time working on bug fixes, writing stored procedures, tuning expensive queries, creating test scenarios, working closely with junior developers, assisting them, and handling production release activities for the team.

## Projects

**[Wordgen](https://github.com/nithinbharathi/wordgen)** -  character-level language models which predict the next character given a sequence of characters as input. In addition to the core MLP architecture, Wordgen also integrates an attention mechanism coded from scratch.  

**[JMatrix](https://github.com/nithinbharathi/JMatrix)** - Java package that is designed for parallel execution of numerical calculations with 2-dimensional matrices efficiently. Operations (non-parallel) also support broadcasting similar to Python's numpy library.


**[Scalargrad](https://github.com/nithinbharathi/Scalargrad)** - reverse automatic differentiation engine that supports simple arithmetic operations on scalar values. A directed acyclic graph records each operation which is later used in computing the derivatives during backpropagation.  

**[Versioneer](https://github.com/nithinbharathi/Versioneer)** - a simple version control system built in Java. Inspired by Git, Versioneer offers functionalities such as init, add, commit, and showdiff.  

**[PatternMatchingSuite](https://github.com/nithinbharathi/pattern-matching-suite)** - FM-index for large DNA sequences. It is highly space-efficient as it uses bit vectors internally for in memory storage and supports search operations like MEM finding and counting occurences of a pattern by using optimised algorithms.   

**[C-STL](https://github.com/nithinbharathi/c-stl)** - C++ STL like library built using C. It currently supports hashtable, linkedlist, stack and queue. This project is a work in progress, with plans to expand and incorporate additional data structures and algorithms.     

**[BoringLang](https://github.com/nithinbharathi/boring-lang)** - minimalistic programming language developed in Java, designed to explore the fundamentals of language design and compiler construction.

## Misc Links
The following are a collection of technical links that I have found to be interesting.

- Jeff Dean's talk on google's infrastructure **[Technology at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=modXC5IWTJI)** and techniques for reducing response times in large scale distributed systems **[Achieving Rapid Response Times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-3Ahy7Fxsc)**.
- **[Distributed Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQP8WApzIQQ&list=PL4YhK0pT0ZhXTRSAYHAgBcJkhlM2hlhw3)**: An interesting course that covers case study's about the various system architectures in use.
- We all love to write fast code and this course Performance Engineering of Software Systems helped me understand the concepts involved in writing high performance software.
- **[LSM](https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying)**: Everything you will need to understand about the widely used Log Structured Merge Trees.
- Andrej Karpathy's wonderful **[Neural Network: Zero to Hero collection](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)**. I would highly recommend this playlist to anyone looking to get started with deep learning.
